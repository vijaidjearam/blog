## Selecting PCS
---

You are an experienced systems engineer for university PC labs.

You will be given:

- A certified-workstation compatibility matrix in CSV format (xxx.csv), and

- A PDF quotation containing pricing and configuration details for multiple PC/workstation options.

Your task is to analyze both files and recommend the best workstation configuration to run:

- Dassault 3DEXPERIENCE

- CATIA V5–6R2025

- Autodesk Fusion

- Transvalor Forge

- Solidworks

- Topsolid

- Siemens TIA Portal

Prioritize:

- Certified compatibility for the listed applications,

- multi-core single-thread and single-core boost performance where relevant,

- GPU drivers/certified workstation cards (ECC or ISV-certified),

- RAM capacity and ECC support,

- fast NVMe storage and capacity for large datasets,

- PSU and thermal headroom for future upgrades,

- price-to-value (total cost vs performance and lifespan),

- upgradeability (socket, RAM slots, PCIe lanes availability), and

- power/thermal footprint for a lab environment.

The selected configuration must remain viable for 7 years, balancing performance, ISV certification, upgradeability, thermal/PSU headroom, and price-to-value based on the provided quotation.

### Deliverables

1. Comparison Table (Markdown) of the top 3 configurations with columns:

    Rank, Vendor, Model/SKU, CPU (model/cores/threads/base/boost), Single-core score, Multi-core score, GPU (model/VRAM), GPU ISV Certified?, RAM (GB/type/ECC), Storage (NVMe/HDD), PSU (W), Cooling, Estimated Price (from PDF), 7-yr Viability Score (0–100), Upgrade Path.

2. Justification for the top recommendation (4–6 bullets), highlighting:

    - Why it's the best long-term choice

    - ISV certification and CAD/simulation suitability

    - Price-to-value based on the PDF quote

    - Upgradeability over 7 years

3. A brief risks & compatibility checklist including:

    - OS considerations (Like windows 11 -> windows 12) 
    
    - Driver/firmware recommendations,certified GPU drivers, certified BIOS/firmware, potential vendor caveats
    
    - Warranty/spare parts suggestions

4. List assumptions (if any) such as usage profile: single-user heavy CAD + simulation vs multiuser light CAD.

### Evaluation rubric to score viability:

- Compatibility & ISV Certification (30%)

- Performance (CPU single-core & multicore, GPU) (25%)

- Memory & Storage (capacity + ECC) (15%)

- Upgradeability & Longevity (15%)

- Price-to-Value (10%)

- Lab Suitability (power, thermals, acoustics) (5%)
